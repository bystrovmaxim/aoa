## [0.0.5] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **English‑only error messages** – all exception messages and user‑facing strings have been translated to English. This ensures consistency and aligns with the project’s internationalization goals.
- **Asynchronous plugin initialization** – `Plugin.get_initial_state()` is now an `async` method. This eliminates the need for `run_in_executor` and allows plugins to perform async I/O during state initialization.
- **Context as a per‑request parameter** – `context` is now passed directly to the `run()` method of all action machines (`BaseActionMachine`, `ActionProductMachine`, `ActionTestMachine`) instead of being stored in the constructor.  
  - This change reflects the fact that the machine is a long‑lived singleton, while each request carries its own context (user, request, environment).  
  - All internal methods that previously accessed `self._context` now receive `context` as an explicit argument.

### Changed
- **Plugin concurrency** – removed the `max_concurrent_handlers` parameter from `ActionProductMachine` and `PluginCoordinator`.  
  - Previously, plugin handlers were limited by an `asyncio.Semaphore` to prevent resource exhaustion.  
  - Since plugins typically perform independent I/O operations (e.g., writing to different databases, queues, or files), the semaphore introduced unnecessary serialization.  
  - Now all matching plugin handlers are executed **fully concurrently** via `asyncio.gather`, reducing overall execution time to that of the slowest handler.
- **All internal comments and docstrings** have been translated to English and updated to reflect the current implementation.
- **Plugin state initialization** – moved from `run_in_executor` to direct `await` of `get_initial_state()`, simplifying the code and making the coordinator fully asynchronous.
- **ActionProductMachine constructor** – removed the `context` parameter; the machine no longer holds request‑specific data.
- **ActionTestMachine constructor** – removed the `ctx` parameter (the test machine now only accepts `mocks`, `mode`, and `log_coordinator`).
- **BaseActionMachine.run() signature** – added mandatory first parameter `context: Context`. The same change applies to `sync_run()`.
- **DependencyFactory.run_action()** – now requires a `context` argument and passes it to the machine’s `run()` method.
- **All related tests** – updated to pass `context` where needed; fixtures and helper functions adjusted accordingly.

### Removed
- **`max_concurrent_handlers`** – no longer accepted in constructors; related logic removed from `PluginCoordinator`.
- **`self._context` attribute** – completely eliminated from `ActionProductMachine` and `ActionTestMachine`.

### Fixed
- **Test suite** – updated concurrency tests to verify that all handlers run in parallel (duration ~ max handler time). Removed obsolete tests that checked semaphore behavior.
- **Exception tests** – aligned with English error messages; all plugin exception tests now pass.
- **Type hints** – ensured all changes are compatible with strict `mypy` checks (no new issues introduced).
- **All 469 tests pass** after the context refactoring; no functionality was broken.

### Security
- No changes.

### Deprecated
- Nothing.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Cross-cutting logging** – implemented the `idea_02` plan to introduce a bound logger into aspects.
  - **Problem:** Previously, logs lacked execution context (machine name, mode, action, aspect), making tracing and filtering difficult.
  - **Solution:** Added the `ActionBoundLogger` class, which is created for each aspect call and automatically adds the following fields to `LogScope`:
    - `machine` – machine class name.
    - `mode` – execution mode.
    - `action` – full action class name.
    - `aspect` – aspect method name.
  - Logging level (`info`, `warning`, `error`, `debug`) is passed via the `"level"` key in `var` (added automatically).
  - User data is passed only via `**kwargs` and ends up in `var`; system fields (except `level`) are not added.
- **Mandatory `log` parameter in aspects** – all aspects are now required to accept the sixth parameter `log: ActionBoundLogger`. Backward compatibility is not maintained (the core is not yet used in production, cleanliness is important).
- **`mode` parameter in machine constructors**:
  - `ActionProductMachine` now requires a mandatory non-empty string parameter `mode`.
  - `ActionTestMachine` defaults to `mode="test"`, but allows overriding.
  - `mode` is passed to `ActionBoundLogger` and ends up in `LogScope`.
- **Logging level support in `ConsoleLogger`**:
  - Added message coloring based on level: `info` — green, `warning` — yellow, `error` — red, `debug` — gray.
  - The unresolved variable marker `<none>` is colored red.
  - If no level is specified, `"info"` is used.
- **Tests for cross-cutting logging**:
  - `tests/logging/test_action_bound_logger.py` – checks logger creation, `emit` calls, `LogScope` formation, handling of user `kwargs`, and ignoring user-supplied `level`.
  - Extended `ActionProductMachine` tests to verify `log` is passed to aspects and `LogScope` correctness.
  - Extended `ActionTestMachine` tests to verify logger works with mocks.
  - Updated `test_console_logger.py` to verify level-based coloring.
- **Documentation** – added a detailed "Cross-cutting Logging" section to `README.md` with concepts, usage examples, and extension guidelines.

### Changed
- **`AspectMethod.__call__` signature** – added a sixth parameter `log`, making `log` mandatory in all aspects.
- **`ActionProductMachine._call_aspect`** – now always creates an `ActionBoundLogger` and passes it to the aspect method (no parameter existence check, as it is mandatory).
- **`LogCoordinator.emit`** – unchanged, but now called from `ActionBoundLogger` with empty instances of `BaseState` and `BaseParams` (instead of `{}` and `None`), matching expected types.
- **`ConsoleLogger.write`** – modified to extract the level from `var` and apply corresponding coloring.

### Fixed
- **Ignoring user-supplied `level`** – added `kwargs.pop("level", None)` in `ActionBoundLogger._emit` to prevent conflict between system and user levels (test `test_user_kwargs_override_nothing`).
- **Type checking (mypy)** – updated the `AspectMethod` protocol in `AspectMethod.py` to include the `log` parameter. Deleted mypy cache, error resolved.
- **Unsorted imports** – fixed all `I001` errors in the project using `ruff --fix`.
- **Removed unused import `BaseState` from `DependencyFactory.py`** (detected by ruff).

### Removed
- **Old aspect signature without `log`** – no longer supported.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-03-18

🎯 Massive refactoring: achieving ideal code quality
This release is dedicated to bringing the project to absolute quality standards. We systematically eliminated all linter warnings, achieved perfect typing, and 100% test pass rate. The project now meets enterprise development standards.

🏗️ Structure and naming
**Problem:** File names did not conform to PEP8 (PascalCase was used instead of snake_case), causing N999 errors in ruff.

**Solution:** Renamed all 18 files in the project according to the snake_case standard:

- `AuthCoordinator.py` → `auth_coordinator.py`
- `Authenticator.py` → `authenticator.py`
- `CheckRoles.py` → `check_roles.py`
- `ContextAssembler.py` → `context_assembler.py`
- `CredentialExtractor.py` → `credential_extractor.py`
- `Context.py` → `context.py`
- `EnvironmentInfo.py` → `environment_info.py`
- `RequestInfo.py` → `request_info.py`
- `UserInfo.py` → `user_info.py`
- `BaseLogger.py` → `base_logger.py`
- `ConsoleLogger.py` → `console_logger.py`
- `ExpressionEvaluator.py` → `expression_evaluator.py`
- `LogCoordinator.py` → `log_coordinator.py`
- `LogScope.py` → `log_scope.py`
- `VariableSubstitutor.py` → `variable_substitutor.py`

🔧 Code quality and linters
**Problem:** Numerous issues from ruff (N999, UP046, C901, W292), mypy (type errors), pylint (R0917, W0621, C0304, R1705).

**Solution:** Conducted a thorough code cleanup:

- Eliminated all 18 ruff errors, including the complexity of the `substitute` function (C901 was reduced from 11 to A(2) by decomposing into `_substitute_simple`, `_substitute_with_iif_detection`, `_substitute_variables`).
- Fixed all mypy errors: removed unused `type: ignore`, fixed the `context()` call in `ActionTestMachine`, added type annotations.
- Achieved pylint rating of 10.00/10 (fixed: unnecessary else in `console_logger._format_line`, name conflict `authenticator` and `context`, missing newline at end of files, too many positional arguments).

🧪 Testing and reliability
**Problem:** Tests did not run due to incorrect imports after file renaming.

**Solution:** Updated all imports in test files (`conftest.py`, `test_auth_coordinator.py`, `test_plugins.py`, etc.). All 341 tests now pass successfully.

**Achieved:** 100% test suite pass rate.

📦 Configuration and tools
**Problem:** Linter configuration was scattered, and some rules conflicted.

**Solution:** Centralized configuration in `pyproject.toml`:

- Configured ruff with conflicting rules disabled (E501, E402, N801, W292).
- Fixed pylint section: removed invalid code W292 (from ruff), added correct code C0304 to disable newline warning.
- Added per-file-ignores rules in ruff.

### Added
- **Linter rule disabling** – added comments to each disabled rule in `pyproject.toml` explaining the reason.
- **Automatic fixing** – added `lint-fix` and `pre-commit` commands to taskipy for automatic formatting fixes.

### Fixed
- **Fixed ABC import in `BaseAction.py`** – replaced incorrect import from `typing` with correct one from `abc` (runtime error).
- **Fixed `authenticator` name conflict** – in `auth_coordinator.py`, renamed constructor parameter from `authenticator` to `auth_instance`, attribute kept as `self.authenticator` (fixed pylint W0621).
- **Fixed `context` name conflict** – in all loggers (`base_logger.py`, `console_logger.py`, `log_coordinator.py`, `variable_substitutor.py`), renamed parameter `context` to `ctx`.
- **Fixed newline warning** – added blank lines at the end of all files where they were missing (C0304).
- **Fixed unnecessary `else` after `return`** – in `console_logger._format_line`, removed redundant branching (R1705).

### Changed
- **Improved code readability** – complex methods decomposed into smaller ones, added detailed comments.
- **Updated documentation** – added usage examples for all key components.

### Removed
- **Obsolete and unused imports** (checked with `vulture`).

## [0.0.2] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Conditional logic in logging templates** – added support for the `{iif(condition; true_value; false_value)}` construct in logger messages.
  - **Problem:** Previously only variable substitution `{%namespace.path}` was possible, but text could not be dynamically changed based on values (e.g., adding a "CRITICAL" marker for large amounts). This limited log expressiveness and forced developers to write additional checks in code.
  - **Solution:** Introduced the `ExpressionEvaluator` class, which safely evaluates expressions inside `iif` using the `simpleeval` library. Supported operators: comparison (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`), logical (`and`, `or`, `not`), arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), built-in functions (`len`, `upper`, `lower`, `format_number`). Variables are substituted as literals before evaluation, ensuring safety and predictability. If an expression is invalid, `LogTemplateError` is thrown (strict policy), allowing immediate detection of template errors.
- **Extracted substitution logic into a separate class `VariableSubstitutor`.**
  - **Problem:** The `LogCoordinator` class contained complex logic for resolving variables and evaluating `iif`, leading to high cyclomatic complexity (B10) and low Maintainability Index (MI 34.95). This hindered testing and further development.
  - **Solution:** Moved all variable substitution and `iif` processing logic into a separate `VariableSubstitutor` class. `LogCoordinator` now only delegates substitution and broadcasts results to loggers. This raised MI of `LogCoordinator` to 100.00, and `VariableSubstitutor` got MI 46.66, indicating good maintainability.
- **Decomposition of `iif` parser** – extracted class `_IifArgSplitter`.
  - **Problem:** The `_split_iif_args` method in `ExpressionEvaluator` had high complexity (B10) due to manual parsing considering nested parentheses and strings. It was hard to read and test.
  - **Solution:** Created a separate `_IifArgSplitter` class implementing a finite state machine for argument parsing. Each method of the class has complexity A(1–2), making the code transparent and easily testable.
- **Validator chain for `_check_connections`.**
  - **Problem:** The `_check_connections` method in `ActionProductMachine` contained multiple rules in one body, giving complexity B10 and making it difficult to test individual rules.
  - **Solution:** Split the method into 4 private validators, each checking one rule of correspondence between passed `connections` and those declared via `@connection`. The main method simply calls them in order. Complexity of the main method reduced to A(5), each validator has complexity A(1–2).
- **Extracted plugin coordinator `PluginCoordinator`.**
  - **Problem:** The `ActionProductMachine` class was responsible for too many concerns (aspects, roles, connections, plugins, execution), resulting in MI 48.45 and making changes to plugin logic difficult.
  - **Solution:** Moved plugin management logic (state initialization, handler caching, asynchronous execution with semaphore) into a separate `PluginCoordinator` class. `ActionProductMachine` delegates plugin calls to it. MI of the main class increased to 51.15, and `PluginCoordinator` has MI 64.22, improving modularity and testability.
- **Improved `ReadableMixin.resolve`** – extracted navigation steps.
  - **Problem:** The `resolve` method contained three traversal strategies in a single loop (complexity B9), making it difficult to add new navigation types (e.g., for `NamedTuple`) and increasing error risk.
  - **Solution:** Extracted the three strategies into separate static methods (`_resolve_step_readable`, `_resolve_step_dict`, `_resolve_step_generic`), and strategy selection into `_resolve_one_step`. Complexity of `resolve` reduced to A(5), each step has complexity A(1–2).

### Fixed
- **Fixed error in `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluate_iif`** – now correctly handles string literals in branches: they are returned without quotes, allowing the result to be used directly in the template.
- **Fixed issue with boolean literals** – expressions now correctly recognize `True` and `False` (instead of invalid `truefalse`).
- **Eliminated `PytestCollectionWarning` for the test class `TestParams`** – renamed the class to `Params_Test` (ignored by pytest).

## [0.0.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Unified data access protocol** – introduced interfaces `ReadableDataProtocol` and `WritableDataProtocol`.
  - **Problem:** Different parts of the framework (aspects, plugins, tests) used various data access methods: some accessed attributes (`params.value`), others expected dictionaries (`state["key"]`). This led to confusion, code duplication, and difficulties when adding new data types (TypedDict, user classes).
  - **Solution:** Protocols define a unified interface for reading (`__getitem__`, `get`, `keys`, ...) and writing (`__setitem__`). Now any object implementing these methods can be used as `Params`, `Result`, or `state` in plugins.
- **Mixins for dataclasses** – `ReadableMixin` and `WritableMixin`.
  - **Problem:** Existing dataclass models (`UserInfo`, `RequestInfo`, `EnvironmentInfo`, as well as user `Params` and `Result`) did not satisfy the new protocols. Rewriting them manually would be labor-intensive.
  - **Solution:** Mixins automatically implement the protocols via reflection (`getattr`, `setattr`). Simply inherit a class from `ReadableMixin` (and/or `WritableMixin`), and it immediately gains dict-like access without changing existing code.
- **Strict typing for `state`.**
  - **Problem:** Previously, `state` was a plain dictionary without any static typing. This led to runtime errors (typos in keys, incorrect types) and hindered refactoring.
  - **Solution:** Now `state` must be typed via `TypedDict` (or a plain dict with annotations). Each aspect receives and returns a strictly typed state. Mypy checks conformance at compile time, and checkers do so at runtime.
- **Asynchronous authentication interfaces.**
  - **Problem:** Components `Authenticator`, `CredentialExtractor`, `ContextAssembler`, and `AuthCoordinator` were synchronous, preventing I/O operations (e.g., token verification via external API) without blocking the event loop.
  - **Solution:** All methods converted to `async def`. Implementations can now use `await` for asynchronous calls. `AuthCoordinator.process()` also became asynchronous and awaits component results.
- **Safe plugin initialization.**
  - **Problem:** The `get_initial_state()` method of plugins was called synchronously inside the async pipeline. If the implementation performed long operations (file reading, API request), it blocked the event loop.
  - **Solution:** Moved the call to a separate thread via `loop.run_in_executor`. Now even "heavy" initialization does not affect performance.
- **Dict-like access for context components.**
  - **Problem:** Components `UserInfo`, `RequestInfo`, and `EnvironmentInfo` were plain dataclasses, accessible only via attributes. This limited their use in plugins and logging, where dict access is more convenient.
  - **Solution:** Classes inherited from `ReadableMixin`. Now they can be accessed as `user["user_id"]`, unifying data access and simplifying serialization.
- **Migration guide** – a detailed document with examples of transitioning to the new version.

### Changed
- **Core (`ActionProductMachine`, `DependencyFactory`)** completely reworked to work via protocols.
  - **Reason:** Eliminate hard binding to `BaseParams`/`BaseResult`. Now the machine accepts any objects satisfying `ReadableDataProtocol` (for `params`) and `WritableDataProtocol` (for `result`). This opens the way to using TypedDict, user classes, and other structures.
- **`BaseParams` and `BaseResult`** are no longer abstract classes; they inherit the corresponding mixins.
  - **Reason:** Maintain backward compatibility. Existing parameter and result classes continue to work but now automatically implement the protocols.
- **Plugins** now receive data via `PluginEvent` with clear types: `params: ReadableDataProtocol`, `state_aspect: Optional[dict[str, object]]`, `result: Optional[WritableDataProtocol]`. All standard plugins rewritten to dict access.
  - **Reason:** Ensure type safety in plugins and unify data access.
- **`sync_run` method** improved: added a more precise error message when called from an async context.
  - **Reason:** Previously the message was uninformative; now the developer immediately understands that `sync_run` cannot be used inside an `async` function.
- **Tests** updated to cover new scenarios: TypedDict as input data, `state` as dict, mocks with `side_effect`, asynchronous authentication, dict access to context components.

### Removed
- **Outdated attribute access to fields** in core and plugins. Now only `obj["key"]`.
  - **Reason:** Unify access and eliminate code duplication.
- **Unused imports and dead code** (checked with `vulture`).

### Fixed
- **Cyclic import in `ActionProductMachine`** (removed incorrect self-import).
- **All `mypy --strict` errors** (project is now fully typed).
- **Achieved maximum `pylint` rating (10.00/10)** and zero `vulture` warnings.
- **Fixed event loop blocking** during plugin state initialization (execution in executor).
- **Fixed missing `await` in `AuthCoordinator.process()`**.
- **Fixed typing error in `ActionTestMachine.run()`** when returning result from `MockAction` (added `cast`).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Basic AOA architecture** – Actions as atomic business operations consisting of a linear sequence of aspects.
- **Base classes** – `BaseAction`, `BaseParams`, `BaseResult` with generics support.
- **Aspects** – decorators `@aspect` and `@summary_aspect` for declaring execution stages. Aspects are called strictly in the order defined in the class (sorted by `co_firstlineno`).
- **Declarative DI** – `@depends` decorator for declaring action dependencies. Support for `factory` parameter for custom object creation.
- **Connection management** – `@connection` decorator for declaring required resource managers. Automatic validation of passed `connections` against declared keys.
- **ActionProductMachine** – production implementation of the action machine with aspect caching, role checking, checker validation, plugin support, and nested calls.
- **ActionTestMachine** – test implementation with dependency mocking via a dictionary of mocks. Automatic wrapping of `BaseResult` and callable into `MockAction`.
- **Plugins** – basic plugin system: `Plugin` class, `@on` decorator for event subscription, isolated plugin state (`get_initial_state`), `ignore_exceptions` support.
- **PluginEvent** – dataclass with full event information: `event_name`, `action_name`, `params`, `state_aspect`, `is_summary`, `deps`, `context`, `result`, `duration`, `nest_level`.
- **Execution context** – classes `UserInfo`, `RequestInfo`, `EnvironmentInfo` and the unifying `Context`. Context is created before action execution and accessible only to plugins and the machine.
- **Authentication** – components `CredentialExtractor`, `Authenticator`, `ContextAssembler` and coordinator `AuthCoordinator` to form Context from a request.
- **Role model** – `@CheckRoles` decorator is mandatory for each action. Support for special values `NONE` (no authentication), `ANY` (any authenticated user), and a list of specific roles.
- **Checkers** – result validation system for aspects via decorators: `IntFieldChecker`, `StringFieldChecker`, `BoolFieldChecker`, `FloatFieldChecker`, `DateFieldChecker`, `InstanceOfChecker`. Each checker validates presence, type, and additional field constraints.
- **Resource managers** – basic hierarchy: `BaseResourceManager`, `IConnectionManager`, concrete implementation `PostgresConnectionManager`, and proxy wrapper `WrapperConnectionManager` for safe connection passing to child actions.
- **Exceptions** – exception hierarchy: `AuthorizationException`, `ValidationFieldException`, `HandleException`, `TransactionException`, `ConnectionAlreadyOpenError`, `ConnectionNotOpenError`, `TransactionProhibitedError`, `ConnectionValidationError`.
- **Helper utilities** – `CoreHelper.run_in_thread` to execute synchronous code in a separate thread without blocking the event loop.
- **Tests** – comprehensive test suite demonstrating aspects, DI, nested actions, plugins, mocks, and integration with external DI containers (inject).
